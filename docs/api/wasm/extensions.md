DuckDB-Wasm (dynamic) extension loading is modeled after regular DuckDB extension loading, with a few relevant differences due to the difference in platform.

### Format

Extensions in DuckDB are binaries to be dynamically loaded via dlopen. A cryptographical signature is appended to the binary.
Extensions in DuckDB-Wasm are a regular Wasm file to be dynamically loaded via Emscripten's dlopen. A cryptographical signature is appended to the Wasm file as a WebAssembly custom section called `duckdb_signature`.
This ensures the file remanins a valid WebAssembly file. Currently we require this custom section to be the last one, but this can be potentially relaxed in the future.

### INSTALL and LOAD

INSTALL semantic in native embeddings of DuckDB is to fetch, decompress from gzip and store data in local disk.
LOAD semantic in native embeddings of DuckDB is to (optionally) perform signature checks AND dynamic load the binary with the main DuckDB binary.

In DuckDB-Wasm, INSTALL is a no-op given there is no durable cross-session storage. LOAD will fetch (and decompress on the fly), perform signature checks *and* dynamically load via the Emscripten implementation of dlopen.

### Autoloading

Autoloading, so the possibility for DuckDB to add extension functionality on-the-fly, is enabled by default in DuckDB-Wasm.

WebAssembly is basically an additional platform, and there might be platform specific limitations that make some extensions not able to match their native capabilities or to perform them in a different way. We will document here relevant differences for DuckDB-hosted extensions.

#### HTTPFS

HTTPFS extension is, at the moment, not available in DuckDB-Wasm. Https protocol capabilities needs to go through an additional layer, the browser, that adds both differences and some restrictions to what's doable from native.

### Extension signing

As with regular DuckDB extensions, DuckDB-Wasm extension are by default checked on LOAD to verify the signature confirm the extension has not been tampered with.
Extension signature verification can be disabled via a configuration option.
Signing is a property of the binary itself, so copying a DuckDB extension (say to serve it from a different location) will still keep a valid signature (for example for local development).

### Fetching DuckDB-Wasm extensions

DuckDB official extension are served at extensions.duckdb.org, and this is also the default value for the `default_extension_repository` option.
On installing extensions, a relevant URL will be built that will look like `extensions.duckdb.org/$duckdb_version_hash/$duckdb_platform/$name.duckdb_extension.gz`.

DuckDB-Wasm extension are fetched only on load, and the URL will look like: `extensions.duckdb.org/duckdb-wasm/$duckdb_version_hash/$duckdb_platform/$name.duckdb_extension.wasm`.

Note that an additional `duckdb-wasm` is added to the folder structure, and the file is served as a `.wasm` file.

DuckDB-Wasm extension are served pre-compressed using brotli compression. While fetched from a browser, extensions will be transparently uncompressed. If you want to fetch duckdb-wasm extension manually, you can use `curl --compress extensions.duckdb.org/......../icu.duckdb_extension.wasm`.

### Serving extension from a third party repository

As with regular DuckDB, if you use `SET custom_extension_repository = some.url.com`, subsequent loads will be attempted at `some.url.com/duckdb-wasm/$duckdb_version_hash/$duckdb_platform/$name.duckdb_extension.wasm`.

Note that GET requests on the extensions needs to be CORS enabled for a browser to allow the connection.

### Tooling

Both extensions and the deployed DuckDB have been compiled using Emscripten 3.1.45.
